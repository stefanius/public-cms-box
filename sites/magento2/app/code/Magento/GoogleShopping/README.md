Magento_GoogleShopping module provides API that enables communication with Google Merchant Center for uploading and editing product data; it replaces depreciated in June 2011 Google Base API.
Google Shopping API consists of two parts: Content and Search.
Content API allows to insert, update, delete and retrieve products information.
Search API allows to search by uploaded items which is not part of this implementation.
